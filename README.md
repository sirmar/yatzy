# But why?
This little project is an excuse for me to test some of the newish features in Python, as well as some (for me at least) new tools. Some of the new features are protocols and type hinting. New tools are github actions, mypy, black and poetry.

This is also a way for me to focus more than usual on good design, linting and unit testing.
